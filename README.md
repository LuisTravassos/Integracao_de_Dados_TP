Integrative Project - Java Data Integration System

This repository contains a Java project developed to meet the requirements of the proposed task, which involves creating a program composed of Wrappers capable of obtaining data from heterogeneous and autonomous sources. Additionally, the system allows the user to view the data in an integrated manner, perform searches, add information according to established schemas, and generate files with selected information.
Key Features

    Data Acquisition: Implementation of Wrappers for obtaining data from distributed and autonomous sources.
    Data Integration: Provision of an interface for integrated data visualization.
    Searches: Ability to perform searches on the obtained data.
    Data Addition: Functionality that enables the user to add data following the defined schemas.
    Information Export: Ability to generate files containing selected information.

Utilized Technologies

    Java Language: Used as the foundation for project development.
    Regular Expressions: Employed in the manipulation and validation of patterns in the obtained data.
    JDOM2 and SAXON APIs: Essential tools for processing and handling XML documents.

Project Structure

    /src: Contains the project's source code.
    /docs: Additional documentation (if any).
    /data: Example data or necessary files for program operation.
    /tests: Test cases and related files.

How to Use

    Clone this repository.
    Open the project in a compatible Java development environment.
    Ensure that dependencies (JDOM2 and SAXON) are properly configured.
    Run the main program and use the interface to interact with the functionalities.
